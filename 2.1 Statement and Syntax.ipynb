    "\n",

    "What Pythom Removes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parentheses are optional\n",
    " We can write as \n",
    "        if (x<y)\n",
    " or \n",

    "2. End of line is end of statement\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the general rule is that the end of a line automatically terminates the statement that appears on that line. In other words, you can leave off the semicolons, and\n",
